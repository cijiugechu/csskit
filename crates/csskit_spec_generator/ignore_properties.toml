[round-display]
# CSS Shapes [CSS-SHAPES-2] define the shape-inside property that aligns contents along the edge of a possibly non-rectangular wrapping area.

[content]

# https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1829). This is properly defined in GCPM. So we should exclude the
# definition from css-content and use the more complete one from gcpm until both issues are properly addressed.
