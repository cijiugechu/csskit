# Properties that require manual Parse implementations instead of generated ones.
#
# Some properties have complex parsing rules that make them difficult or impractical
# to express using the derive(Parse) macro. For these properties, we exclude Parse
# from the generated derive list, allowing developers to provide custom implementations.

[writing-modes]
# Properties with hand-written Parse implementations
# glyph-orientation-vertical: Requires special handling for literal integers and dimensions
properties = ["glyph-orientation-vertical"]

[gaps]
# Properties with hand-written Parse implementations
# column-rule/row-rule: Intentionally parse both forms through the flattened GapRuleList type.
properties = ["column-rule", "row-rule"]
