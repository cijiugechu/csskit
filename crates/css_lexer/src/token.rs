/// An abstract representation of the chunk of the source text, retaining certain "facts" about the source.
///
/// # Design
///
/// The [Token] type is an immutable packing of two [u32s][u32] that represents a unit in the source text, but without
/// the associated offset data that points to its position in the source text. This is important because it means that
/// equivalent [Tokens][Token] are equal even in different parts of the document. For the most part a [Token] doesn't
/// represent data that can be put into a text file because it lacks the underlying character data. It is lossy. For
/// example a [Token] with [Kind::Ident] just represents _an_ ident, but it doesn't retain what the keyword is).
/// Storing raw-character data would require either storing tokens on the heap (and therefore they couldn't be [Sized])
/// or by keeping a reference to `&'a str` which means larger token sizes and lifetime tracking. By _not_ storing
/// character data we can keep [Token] [Sized] and keep it to `size_of` `8`, avoiding the heap, avoiding
/// references/lifetimes, and keeping [Token] entirely in the stack. For a lot of tokens this is _fine_ because the
/// underlying character data isn't that useful past a certain point.
///
/// A [Token] retains certain "facts" about the underlying unit of text, though. For example it retains the [Kind], how
/// many characters the token consumed, and various other pieces of information, depending on the [Kind]. In some
/// cases, it's entirely possible to represent the full token, including character data, into the available bits (for
/// example [Kind::Delim] stores its [char], [Kind::Number] stores its [f32]). Taking the time in the tokenizer to
/// gather these facts and values can keep cache-lines hot, which speeds up subsequent checks in the parser.
///
/// If you're familiar with "red green" syntax trees such as [Swiftlang's libsyntax][1], or [Rust-Analyzer's Rowan][2]
/// or [Roslyn][3] this might be a little familiar in some concepts. However [Token] does not represent a tree, and
/// relies on resorting back to the string data to find out keyword values.
///

/// This representation of facts, kind, length, or other metadata can be quite complex - so here's a
/// full breakdown:
///
/// # Anatomy of Token
///
/// A [Token] is a struct of `(u32, u32)`. The second u32 is _usually_ the token length (hence keeping them separate).
/// The first [u32], however, is split into 3 (sometimes 5) parts. The two u32s can be thought of like so:
///
/// ```md
///   |-----|-------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
///   | TF  | K     | VD                       | Value                           |
/// 0b| 000 | 00000 | 000000000000000000000000 | 0000000000000000000000000000000 |
///   |-----|-------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
///   | 3-- | 5---- | 24---------------------- | 32----------------------------- |
/// ```
///
/// ## TF = Type Flags (or "Token Facts")
///
/// This represents a bit-mask in the upper-most 3 bits. The flags are general purpose and change meaning depending on
/// the Token's [Kind]. Each flag generally maps to a method so it's not necessary to remenber the contents of this
/// table, but it can serve as a useful reference. Note that not all methods return a [bool], so footnotes have been
/// added to explain these further.

/// return the [Whitespace] enum for improved readability.
/// [^comments]: Rather than using the 3 bits as a bit-mask, Comment tokens use the data to store the [CommentStyle]
/// enum, which is capable of representing 8 discrete comment styles.
/// [^delim]: Delims can be used in interesting ways inside of CSS syntax. At higher levels CSS is _sometimes_
/// whitespace sensitive, for example the whitespace inside of a CSS selector _sometimes_ represents the descendant
/// combinator, meanwhile delimiters inside calc() are sensitive to whitespace collapse (`calc(1px + 1px)` is valid
/// while `calc(1px+1px)` is a parse error). Further to this, introducing whitespace (say through a formatter) might
/// break in interesting ways due to some combinations of Delims & Idents - for example Pseudo Classes like `:hover`,
/// or CSS like languages such as SASS using `$var` style syntax. While `:hover` and `$var` are comprised of two tokens
/// they're considered one conceptual unit. Having a way to express these relationships at the token level can be useful
/// for other low level machinery such as formatters/minifiers, rather than introducing complex state at higher levels.
/// For these reasons, Delim tokens have the ability to express their whitespace association. The lexer will always
/// produce a token with empty whitespace rules, but parsers can replace this token with a more complex set of rules.
///
/// ## K = Kind Bits
///
/// The `K` value - upper-most bits 4-9 stores the 5-bit [Kind].
///
/// ## VD = Value Data
///
/// The `VD` value - the lower-most 24-bits - stores data depending on the [Token] [Kind]. For most kinds this data is
/// reserved (just 0s). The value data cannot be interrogated manually, but it packs in additional data about the
/// underlying string to make the string easier to parse without doing the same lookups that the tokenizer already had
/// to - such as determining lengths of the various parts of the token, or packing values so that consulting the string
/// can be avoided (which keeps cache-lines hot).
///
/// Below describes the special kinds which use the Value Data to store yet more information about the token...
///
/// ### Value Data for [Kind::Ident], [Kind::Function], [Kind::AtKeyword]
///
/// If the [Kind] is [Kind::Ident], [Kind::Function], or [Kind::AtKeyword] then Value Data represents the Ident's "Atom
/// Data". When lexing one of these tokens the Lexer will pass the string slice to [DynAtomSet][crate::DynAtomSet] and
/// set this bits accordingly. This allows implementations to provide a [DynAtomSet][crate::DynAtomSet] of interned
/// strings to improve performance of string comparisons. The `ATOM_DYNAMIC_BIT` can be used to dynamically intern
/// strings during runtime (this behaviour is abstracted by [DynAtomRegistry][crate::DynAtomRegistry]). This 24-bits
/// allows for ~16MM unique strings, but with the `ATOM_DYNAMIC_BIT` this becomes ~8MM static atoms and ~8MM dynamic
/// atoms (very unlikely CSS will ever reach even 10k predefined keywords, and most CSS files will have less than 1000
/// unique strings).
///
/// ### Value Data for [Kind::Number]
///
/// If the [Kind] is [Kind::Number], Value Data represents the length of that number (this means the parser is
/// restricted from representing numbers longer than 16,777,216 characters which is probably an acceptable limit). Note
/// that this does not affect the _value_ of a number, just the characters in a string. Numbers in CSS are [f32]. The
/// vast majority of [f32s][f32] can be represented in 16MM characters, but it's possible to author a document that
/// contains a set of numeric characters longer than 16MM code points. These scenarios are considered [undefined
/// behaviour][1].
///
/// [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior
///
/// ### Value Data for [Kind::Hash]
///
/// If the [Kind] is [Kind::Hash], Value Data represents the length of that hash (this means the parser is restricted
/// from representing IDs and hex codes longer than 16,777,216 characters which is probably an acceptable limit). Note
/// that this restriction means that ID selectors have a much tigher limit than other tokens, such as strings or
/// idents, but it's very unlikely to see a 16million character ID in CSS (String, maybe).
///
/// ### Value Data for [Kind::Url]
///
/// If the [Kind] is [Kind::Url], Value Data represents the "leading length" and "trailing length" of the URL. This
/// means the value data is split into two 12 bit numbers:
///
/// ```md
/// |--------------|--------------|
/// | LL           | TL           |
/// | 000000000000 | 000000000000 |
/// |--------------|--------------|
/// | 12---------- | 12---------- |
/// ```
///
/// The "leading" length represents the `url(` part of the token. Typically this will be `4`, however it's possible
/// (for legacy compatibility reasons within CSS) to add whitespace between the opening parenthesis and the URL value.
/// It's also possible to escape the `url` ident portion. This means `\75\52\6c(   ` is also a valid leading section of
/// a URL ident (which has a character length of 13), as is `\000075 \000052 \00006c (   ` (28 characters). 12 bits
/// allows for a maximum character length of 4,096. It is not possible to represent a URL token's leading section using
/// 4,096 characters so there is some headroom (wasted bytes) here.
///
/// The "trailing" length represents the `)` part of the token. Typically this will be `1`, however it's possible to
/// add any number of whitespace characters between the end of the URL and the closing parenthesis. If a CSS document
/// contains more than 4095 whitespace characters then this is considered [undefined behaviour][4].
///
/// ### Value Data for [Kind::Dimension]
///
/// If K is a Dimension, then this represents both the number of characters in the numeric portion of the dimension
/// and the length of the ident portion of the dimension... or the dimension unit itself (more on that below). This
/// means the value data is split into two 12 bit numbers:
///
/// ```md
/// |--------------|--------------|
/// | NL           | DUL          |
/// | 000000000000 | 000000000000 |
/// |--------------|--------------|
/// | 12---------- | 12---------- |
///
/// |--------------|-------| --------|
/// | NL           | KDUL  | KNOWN   |
/// | 000000000000 | 00000 | 0000000 |
/// |--------------|-------| --------|
/// | 12---------- | 5---- | 7------ |
/// ```
///
/// The NL portion - the numeric length - represents the length of characters the number contains. This means the
/// numeric portion of a dimension can only be 4,096 characters long. This is dramatically shorter than the 16MM
/// allowed for numbers but it's still also incredibly generous such that it's highly unlikely to ever be hit unless
/// someone is intentionally trying to break the parser. The [Lexer][super::Lexer] encountering a dimension with a
/// numeric portion longer than 4,096 characters is considered [undefined behaviour][4].
///
/// The DUL portion (if `TF & 100 == 0`) will represent the length of characters the ident portion of the dimension
/// (aka the dimension unit) contains. This means the ident portion of a dimension can only be 4,096 characters long.
/// For practical purposes CSS has a fixed set of dimensions - the longest of which (at the time of writing) are 5
/// characters long (e.g. `svmax`). Through the use of escaping shenanigans it's possible to create a valid CSS
/// dimension longer than 5 characters though (every ident can be made 8 times longer by using escape characters, e.g.
/// `1svmax` at 6 characters can be instead written as `1\000073 \000076 \00006d \000061 \000078` at 40 characters). In
/// addition to these factors, it's worth pointing out that there is scope for further dimensions and some [proposals
/// for "custom" dimensions][5], and lastly this library is designed for CSS _and CSS-alike_ languages, which may
/// invent their own dimension units. In other words being too restrictive on dimension ident length could be costly
/// in the future, therefore 4,096 characters seems like a reasonable, if generous, trade-off.
///
/// There's a giant caveat here though. If `TF & 100 != 0`, then the dimension is considered "known" and DUL will be
/// encoded differently. Instead of just containing the dimension unit length, which requires consulting the underlying
/// `&str` to get the actual dimension, it will be used to store an Atom - but only the first 7 bits (the KNOWN
/// portion), which for an Atom must be a Dimension atom (an assummption made on anything that implements
/// [AtomSet][crate::AtomSet] is that all dimension units should be stored in the byte values of 1-127, so that they
/// can be encoded in this space). Dimension units _can_ be escape encoded, and so the underlying character data may
/// differ from the unescaped unit length, as such 5-bit KDUL portion represents character data length, in other words
/// `KNOWN.len()` may not always equal KDUL`.
///
/// [5]: https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7379
///
/// ## Value
///
/// The `Value` portion of [Token] represents the length of the token for most token kinds. However, for some tokens
/// their length is already packed into the first u32. So it would make more sense to use this u32 to store more
/// interesting data.
///
/// ## Value for [Kind::Delim] and single character tokens
///
/// [Kind::Delim] and single-character tokens (i.e. [Kind::Colon]->[Kind::RightCurly]) typically have a length of `1`
/// ([Kind::Delim] can have a varied length for surrogate pairs). Instead of storing the length and wasting a whole
/// [u32], this region stores the [char]. Calling [Token::char()] will return an [Option] which will always be [Some]
/// for [Kind::Delim] and single-character tokens.
///
/// ## Value for [Kind::Hash]
///
/// The length of a hash is stored in its `VD` portion, leaving 32bits to storing other data. It just so happens that
/// a 8-character hex code (#ffaabbcc) fits nicely inside of 32-bits. During tokenization we can eagerly parse the hex
/// code and stuff it here, so it can be more easily reasoned about in upstream code (rather than
/// reading the character data).
///
/// ## Value for [Kind::Number] and [Kind::Dimension]
///
/// As these tokens store their length data in the `VD` portion, this [u32] instead stores the _value_ of the number,
/// stored as [f32::to_bits()].
///
/// ## Value data for other tokens.
///
/// In all other cases, this represents the length of the token as utf-8 bytes. This means the token length is
/// 4,294,967,296 aka ~4GB. This sounds very long but also CSS can host very large image data and browsers will
/// accomodate very large URLs. [An mdn article on Data URLs][6] claims that Firefox supports 32mb Data URLs, Chrome
/// supports over 512mb, and Safari over 2gb. The reality is that if someone has such a large data URL in their CSS
/// they probably should split it out, but we have a whole 32 bits to store the length so we may as well use it...
